# STA2005S Experimental Design Assignment

### Authors:
- Manelisi Luthuli (LTHMAN009)
- Zenande Mangcipu (MNGZEN008)

## Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to compare the efficiency of various sorting algorithms by measuring the time taken to sort randomly generated datasets of different sizes. This allows for an understanding of how each algorithm performs under different conditions, specifically varying data sizes. The data is then analysed in "Report.Rmd" which is R Markdown code which outputs the "Report.pdf".

### Sorting Algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

## Sources of Variation
- **Treatment Factor**: Sorting algorithm, with 3 levels (Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort).
- **Blocking Factor**: The size of the arrays being sorted, with levels 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, and 400,000 elements.

## What the Code Does

This project contains several classes that work together to generate random data, apply sorting algorithms, and record the time taken to sort the data into an Excel sheet. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key classes:

### 1. **`Data.java`** (Main Class)
   - This is the main class where the experiment is run.
   - It generates an Excel file named `ExperimentalDesign.xlsx` that stores the results of sorting the random arrays.
   - The `Data` class coordinates the entire experiment, calling methods from other classes to generate arrays, shuffle them, and apply sorting algorithms.
   - The time taken to sort each array is recorded in milliseconds and saved in the Excel file, which includes details like the array size, sorting algorithm, and time taken.

### 2. **`ArrayGeneration.java`** (Array Generation)
   - This class is responsible for generating arrays of random integers.
   - It uses two sources of randomness:
     - `/dev/urandom`: A Unix-based source of random numbers.
     - The Random.org API: A true random number generator that produces numbers based on atmospheric noise.
   - Arrays of different sizes (50,000, 100,000, 200,000, and 400,000 elements) are generated and stored in `ArrayList` objects, which are then used in the experiment.

### 3. **`Shuffler.java`** (Array Shuffling)
   - The `Shuffler` class shuffles the order of the arrays to ensure randomization.
   - It uses the indices generated by the `RandomArrayIndexes` class to shuffle the arrays.
   - This ensures that the arrays are not processed sequentially and the sorting algorithms are applied to arrays in a randomized order.

### 4. **`RandomArrayIndexes.java`** (Random Index Generation)
   - This class uses the Random.org API to generate unique random indices that are used to shuffle arrays.
   - The generated indices are then used to determine which arrays to shuffle and in what order they will be sorted.
   - The randomized indices ensure that the experiment is conducted in a fair, unbiased order.

### 5. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - **Bubble Sort**, **Heap Sort**, and **Quick Sort** are implemented as separate methods within the `Data` class.
   - Based on the randomly assigned index, one of these sorting algorithms is applied to the array.
   - After sorting, the time taken is measured and stored in the Excel file.

### 6. **Excel Output**
   - Apache POI is used to write the results of the sorting experiment into an Excel file.
   - The `Data` class records:
     - The sorting algorithm used
     - The size of the array
     - The time taken to sort the array (in milliseconds)
   - The final result is saved in `ExperimentalDesign.xlsx`.
